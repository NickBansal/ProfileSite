# Nick Bansal - Profile Site
## React JS

Welcome to the wonderful world of me - This is my profile site made from scratch using ReactJS showcasing my skills and also giving links to my other projects


## Using my site
I have deployed my project on the following link using Heroku: https://nickbansal.herokuapp.com/ for your viewing pleasure. Please feel free to browse the site.

## Functionality

### - Navbar
I have implemented a fully working navbar that allows you to scroll to certain sections of the page. For this I used an NPM package [react-scroll-into-view](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scroll-into-view)

### - Landing Page
I have inserted links to my public profiles here including Github, codewars, stack overflow and codepen. Again... take a look

### - Project Page
I have listed all the projects that I feel would be of initerest to look at and I have used a carousel from [react-slick](https://react-slick.neostack.com/) in order to show them all
